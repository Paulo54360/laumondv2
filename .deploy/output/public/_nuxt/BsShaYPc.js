Rather than a profusion of colours and figurative and narrative tendencies, Laumond's installations are a priori embodied in abstraction, but also in the rigour and the coolness of an immaculate white. The forms are geometric, the lines straight, regular and homogeneous. The tensions and obliques underline an operative dynamic, at once mathematical, structural, even universal. However, unlike the leading exponents of Minimalism, such as Malevich's Suprematism or Mondrian's Neoplasticism, Laumond expresses no desire to strip life of life, that is to say, the sensitive and subjective part of the world, in order to reveal a phantasmal essence. Initiator of metaHism, whose prefix META denotes the Whole, ISME its own artistic trend and H, the eighth letter of the alphabet, an infinite movement symbolised by the lemniscate ∞, Laumond does not seek to formalise an art deprived of sentiment which would flirt, as was the case in the last century, with the totalitarian overtones and masculine values of modernity. Rather, in this almost tautological paradigm, we find the desire to inscribe an irresistible flaw, thus elevating contingency, accident and tilting to the rank of indispensable partners. The motif of the grid, driven by a supposed purity, neutrality and orderliness of things, will thus always be countered by a stain, drips or fractures. If Universal Concordance seems a distant evocation of the Minimalist vocabulary, with its pared-down forms, its monochromes and its utopias of metaphysical transcendence, it is ultimately the distortions of space, time and consciousness that retain the artist. Because if the matrix grid functions in a spatial and temporal manner, with its Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and its temporal reference t, for Laumond, it is the means by which consciousness reconnects to the multiple dimensions of reality, rather than repressing them. Embedded in rigid frameworks, his work constantly tends to resist the measure of an inflated rationality that detaches us from the sensitive world. In this way, modernist and Western considerations are decentred in favour of notions that privilege movement over structure, relationship over terms, contingency over necessity, otherness over identity. Rather than advocating frontality, modularity or repetition, his installations summon chaos through multiple ramifications and connections, where everything seems to be linked by a thin thread. In this sense, metaHism is an invitation to multiply perspectives and to embrace complexity. For if for a Westerner, consciousness is always a mental phenomenon: 'I think, therefore I am', it is because he apprehends the world only through his unique point of view, according to the symbolic model of the linear perspective that placed him at the centre of the world. By multiplying the focal points, a whole spectrum of consciousnesses is offered to us: animal, vegetable, cellular, molecular or atomic. Mental consciousness is only a human range that does not exhaust the gradation of possible consciousnesses, just as human sight does not exhaust all the gradations of colour nor does hearing those of sound. There is thus a range of consciousnesses, supramental and subramental, inaccessible to the human being, which in fact appear to be impossible, invisible or unconscious. In this way, metaHism is an attempt to reconcile the dichotomies laid down by modernity, and to include the various modes of existence that populate the world. As a result, it is no longer time and space that are the framework of phenomena, but bodies and the imperceptible interactions that influence them, as Einstein foresaw in general relativity. To grasp metaHism, we will therefore have to put on the glasses of a Möbius strip and accept that there is no longer linear or causal time, top or bottom, interiority or exteriority, order or disorder, but an intermingling of all possibilities, of which contingency is the name."}},AuteurCU:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:"Marion Zilio, Art critic and Curator."}}},CDA:{TitreCDA:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:"MétaHisme, an attempt to expand the possible"}},Texte1CDA:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:'A white space within a black space.

In his hometown of Saint-Viance within the Espace Labasse – a historic building – the artist tries his hand at the difficult reconciliation of philosophies sciences and beliefs.

However it should not be assumed from this that Laumond functions according to a reductive binarism or Manichaeism. On the contrary he embraces opposites in order to make them converse and reason together thereby insisting on the plurality of perspectives rather than the naïve affirmation of a universal world that is to say versed in a single truth (which we know is often that of the dominant party). So is it possible to combine knowledge which is usually opposed like that of quantum mechanics with the theory of general relativity which describe respectively phenomena at the microscopic and macroscopic levels? Like so many physicists who dedicate their life to a hypothetical Theory of Everything capable of presiding over and subsuming the fundamental interactions of physics Laumond multiplies the attempts to reunite antagonistic systems. Based on the principle of quantum entanglement and the inseparability of particles like Plato's "soulmates" Stephen Hawking's "parallel universes" or "Rorschach tests" from clinical psychology the artist expends great effort in connecting worlds in a gesture that is both futile and poetic. Like magnets that repel or attract one another depending on their magnetic pole he searches for the motive or let's say the method to make these invisible tensions tangible. His work paradoxically hermetic and open plural and singular made up of suspended grids monoliths and mobiles definitively invites us to a meditation on the power of parallel worlds. Whether we believe that these universes are separated by immeasurable swaths of space or time or imperceptibly exist only a few millimeters from us the hypothesis of multiverses has become over recent years a theoretical configuration supported by the majority of advances in fundamental physics. However what the artist implicitly tells us here is that we ourselves live within these multiple interlocking universes. Each one of us has a singular view of the world and develops a specific technical scientific philosophical or poetic language and vocabulary. Hence the illusion of misunderstanding between individuals and the feeling of sometimes living in dissimilar universes presided over by distinct laws which only a theory that combines different viewpoints will be likely to unite. The alliance is difficult but that's also what creates the charm of these two magnets like lovers who attract and repel one another constantly.`}},AuteurCDA:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:"Marion Zilio, art critic and curator (AICA France Member)."}}},biography:{intro_text:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:"Patrick Laumond was born to a father from Cantal, a hydromechanics engineer, and a mother born in Brive la Gaillarde, trained as an aesthetician.

Constrained by his father who enrolled him at the Pierre Caraminot National Professional School in Egletons, he was a boarder there until obtaining his baccalaureate in mechanical engineering. At the time of choices, he joined the Henri Brisson National Higher Professional School in 1994, where he learned applied science in technical and industrial ceramics, in Vierzon. He was noticed by Jacky Trotereau, professor and head of the ceramics art and decoration laboratory, who allowed him direct entry into the 2nd year at the National Higher School of Arts and Applied Arts in Paris at Olivier de Serres (ENSAAMA). He graduated top of his class with jury congratulations for the presentation of his personal portfolio in 1996. At the same time, he did an internship with Delphine Charlotte Parmentier where he conceptualized accessories for Ungaro and Christian Lacroix and objects for the ceramics museum in Dunkerque. He decided to return to his native land in Corrèze and set up a ceramics workshop in the family home which he abandoned a few years later to become an artist. Back in Paris, he devoted himself essentially to painting. He met Madame Denyse Durand Ruel several times who supported him to participate in the prestigious residency of the French Institute in Japan (Villa Kujoyama) which was refused to him despite her recommendation.

This "theory of Everything" allows him to present in each installation a cross-vision of several cultures; religions, sciences, politics and the human condition from all angles. Complex vision, humanistic and humorous vision, global and fragmented vision, paradoxical vision, his universe where white dominates is an invitation to interiority. As Edgard Morin writes, "The real problem is that we have learned too well to separate. It is better to learn to connect. To connect, that is to say not only to establish end to end a connection, but to establish a connection that is made in a loop." Laumond's research is that of a reconstruction of link, loop, circle in which the movement of life can be written in its infinite diversity and its infinite possibilities. Search for a universal model: His quest is that of writing a universal model. "I realized that it is manifestly impossible to present what surrounds us through a single work, a monobloc work. This led me to produce a more theoretical modeling that must consist of a work distributed in several elements, distinct from each other demonstrating the ALL and its opposite. This modeling results in what could be called a representation of the Great ALL" Laumond The conception of what he calls "the Work", thus evoking the globality of his language and the result of his long research work, comes from an allegory of the Big Bang. This mysterious moment when the world self-produced. By creating his own language, Laumond creates a multidimensional space and puts into perspective the paradox; the idea of the signifier and the insignificant, balances in imbalance, full and empty, the passage from one state to another and all this in a representation of a coherent model. This representation also takes into account artistic movements, by merging them, cubism, minimalism, readymade, pointillism, figurative, abstraction, are found in his formal evocation.`}},creation_title:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:"Creating a language, a challenge:"}},creation_text:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:'How to tell the world in a single work?

The white work is a potential representation of all possible like infinity, eternity, the limit in the unlimited, it is always in opposition, connected to the stained work. They always position themselves in dialogue with each other encompassing a central work which is a different representation in form but identical in the idea of thought...". Laumond Where the writer will use words to write his story, where ideograms have allowed with simple strokes the creation of a language without limits, Laumond has created a "universal language". In the Laumond universe, subjects, thoughts, concepts are symbolized by simple elements represented by a "volumetric structure", variable and yet constant form. His words are white or glass volumes and volumes worked in monochrome (stained). The volumes: Whether they are full or empty, white or transparent, immaculate or identified by their "stain", whether they are alone or connected to others, whatever their size, their shape, each of these volumes carries its meaning. They become parables. The link: Connected by an infinity of gray lines, which mark, unify, cut or connect space and works to each other, the volumes tell the global story. The stain: At the origin of his creative process, it is a monochrome worked to the extreme, "mistreated" to become alive.

The vision he has of it is empathetic and encompasses a philosophical, scientific, humanistic and sensitive gaze. He has managed to develop a universe of absolute coherence. At the service of an endless reading and yet specific to each. The spectator becomes a true actor in the interpretation of these parables. He expresses a sharp, deep and acute gaze on the world, on its formats and on the "human comedy".

In 2009, he conceptualized the MetaHism manifesto in the form of a work of art. Ten years later, he writes an undeclared declaration. In 2021, he is invited by the European Cultural Center of Italy (ECC Italy) to exhibit on the occasion of the Venice Biennale at the Bembo Palace. He exhibits "Universal Concordance". On the same occasion, he meets Marion Zilio, art theorist, art critic and member of AICA France. She writes an analysis that accompanies his work during his exhibition.
