# Vue.js Rules

## Component Structure
- ✓ Use `<script setup>` syntax
- ✓ Order: script, template, style
- ✓ Style should be scoped by default
- ✓ Keep components focused and small

## Props & Emits
- ✓ Props must have type definitions
- ✓ Props must have default values
- ✓ Use TypeScript for prop types
- ✓ Define emits with TypeScript types

## Template Rules
- ✓ Use PascalCase for components in template
- ✓ Use kebab-case for custom events
- ✓ Maximum 1 expression per v-if/v-for
- ✓ No side effects in template expressions

## Composition API
- ✓ Use composables for reusable logic
- ✓ Define refs with type annotations
- ✓ Group related reactive state
- ✓ Use computed properties for derived state

## State Management
- ✓ Use Pinia for global state
- ✓ Keep component state local when possible
- ✓ Use provide/inject for deep props
- ✓ Document state management decisions
