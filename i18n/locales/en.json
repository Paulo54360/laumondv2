        "ArticleLinkText": "Read the interview on Champs Libres Media",
        "Footnote": "*The Manifesto of MetaHism already exists; this theoretical work is concretized as a work in itself consultable on request.",
        "Texte": "Today in our materialistic society of hyper-individualism, man is dehumanized and paradoxically the cult of ego continues to take precedence over our personal development and therefore over our evolution towards a search for universal meaning. The genesis of MetaHism finds its origin in this reflection. For Patrick Laumond, it has always been necessary to define oneself as making art rather than being an artist. Although this is often understood as being a corollary to the act of creation, it seems to him that it is not the artist who determines art, but art which on the contrary determines the artist.",
        "Texte2": "This approach guided his personal research journey and led him to create MetaHism. This art of consciousness has matured over thirty years of experimentation, reflection and readings as transversal as they are a priori antagonistic (from quantum scientific thesis through philosophy and spirituality). From a plastic point of view, he has experimented with everything. He always ended up confronting the limits of what already existed in art, a mirror effect, reducing the evolution of his own consciousness and what he had to say. Thus, he never ceased to seek to transcend the existing, by transcribing a new complex thought.",
        "Texte3": "Since always, the artist has had the vocation to respond to commissions, calls for proposals. Today, in our consumer society, he seeks to create buzz and must be an entrepreneur converted to merchandising, which can have the perverse effect of limiting his own freedom of thought and creation.",
        "Texte4,1": "MetaHism articulates a plastic language to make the object of consciousness perceptible through art.",
        "Texte4,2": "MetaHism is a material support to make the object of consciousness understood through art.",
        "Texte4,3": "MetaHism is a materialization of the fundamentals of consciousness in its globality applied to art; what he calls the fundamental consciousness of the Whole.",
        "Texte5": "Today, in our society of dematerialization, all mediums have been exploited (painting, sculpture, installation, video...) and everything can be art (the manufactured object, the consumer product, the concept, the artist himself...).",
        "Texte6,1": "MetaHism is not a critique of art but a new form of artistic consciousness that encompasses, merges all dimensions of art.",
        "Texte6,2": "MetaHism gives new meaning to art by creating a new form of multidimensional language whose statements can be declined infinitely in dialogical form of correspondences.",
        "Texte7": "Today, in our society, all thought must be determined, stopped, objectified without leaving any place for uncertainty and indeterminism.",

        "Texte10,3": "MetaHism is a meditative invitation to the here and now.",
        "Texte11": "Likewise, the notion of anthropocentrism would be an illusion of our place in the Universe. At the time of ecosystem upheaval, Man cannot deny that he is only the tiny element of a great Whole of which he is part.",
        "Texte12,1": "MetaHism is a Holographic work. Each volume serves the whole. The whole is more than the sum of its parts, the part is in the whole, but the whole is in the part. The most common example is that of an individual's genetic heritage found in each cell that composes it.",
        "Texte12,2": "MetaHism invites us to overcome all forms of individualism.",

        "Texte12,6": "MetaHism invites us to connect antagonisms; consciousness and unconsciousness, materiality and immateriality, visible and invisible, temporal and timeless, interiority and exteriority, limit and infinity or continuous and discontinuous.",
        "Texte12,7": "MetaHism is part of a change of era of which it is the transcription.",
        "Texte13": "'Meta, because expressing the whole, ism as concept and universal suffix, which we find in all movements and H, eighth letter of the alphabet, (letter of infinity, ∞, lemniscate) and separator. Letter with high symbolic significance. Cerebral and sensitive, virtual and real, painting, sculpture, concept, installation, LAUMOND's work is all this and much more. Born from an approach of absolute rigor, his work remains the most radical manifestation of a spirit in freedom.'",

A vision that is simultaneously complex, humanist and humorous, global and fragmented, paradoxical. His universe, where the color white dominates, is an invitation to inwardness. At each event, he confirms powerful progress, details his immaculate universe and announces the next steps in the service of inner proliferation.",
        "Texte2LAEC": "The content hidden behind his narrative boxes, interlocking volumes, puzzle-like constructions, is dense. These are small parables; they balance and demonstrate the equivalent value of small and large, strong and weak, positive and negative, male and female, the chromosomes of perfection and imperfection, time, space... In his \"boxes\", the balance between hierarchical values or positions is fragile, but preserved: balance, because how can it be judged and weighed? Fragile, because all of this comes down to so little… Its humanism emerges slowly, almost without his knowledge...",
        "Texte3LAEC": "In keeping with Fischli and Weiss and their small sculptures exhibited recently at the Tate Modern, he provides us with visual interrogations on everything that surrounds us, the art world, its references and the end of painting, the artists and movements that preceded him, Duchamp, Fontana, but as a subtle and fertile analyst, he provides his visual and formal response, his vision, his kaleidoscopic interplay and an aesthetics based on perfection.",
        "Texte4LAEC": "His large volumes recount the history of our society, its artificial markers and guideposts that he decomposes and recomposes in a joyful fresco. He distorts the appropriation of a name, that of the artist, of a mark, a color, and other external attributes from which he extracts meaning in order to show its limits.",
        "Texte5LAEC": "His formal conception of art is completely singular, like that of his writing. A language of symbols, consistent, rigorous and codified, extremely precise elaboration and construction, his work has a remarkable solidity.",
        "Texte6LAEC": "Remarkable in both senses of the word: first through its uniqueness. This is pure Laumond, recognizable among all, never borrowing, just patiently constructed with the force of intense diligence and searching, and secondly remarkable through the precision and high quality of his craftsmanship. He seems to have retained in the creation of his works the respect for his elders and the patience of flawless elaboration without concessions. Everything is made to last.",
        "Texte10LAEC": "A box – a story, coming one after the other, enriched each time by the following step. It is a fluid and cryptic phrasing, a series of symbols and images that recount his worlds, their complexity, their paradoxical ambivalence and their possible unity.",
        "Texte12LAEC": "Proliferation and ramifications, everything is separable while being connected, like our Internet world. This Web that characterizes our era is an underlying framework for his work. Laumond is part of our era; he embodies it with a detachment resulting from intelligence and humor. He has his vision, powerful, proliferating and intense. His work provides room for contemplation, meditation. An allegoric vision is never simple and requires the observer to put in some work; however, Laumond's renders us active and meditative.",
        "Texte13LAEC": "In him, there is a subtle dividing line between the feeling of urgency and the patience necessary for his constructional interplay.",
        "Texte14LAEC": "At the Espace Commines, we enter into his work with a code, put on slippers, and only then can we penetrate the work, because the space that is dedicated to him is a work in itself; he characterizes it as such, one and divisible, a whole and at the same time a collection of its components.",
        "Texte15LAEC": "Complex? And yet simple, everything is in everything, and there is a beginning and an end...",
        "Texte16LAEC": "The first room in the overall work that is the exhibition space contains his birthdate, three plaques, a long chain and a key. This all makes sense at the end of the exhibit when the final box speaks of the end of his life, a small virtual vault, undated, with no numbers, just there as a reminder that everything dies on this earth, an allegory of vanities, Penone is not far off. Laumond's existential anguish is significant.",
        "Texte17LAEC": "It feeds and punctuates his work; it gives him this driving force, intimates to him the urgency of creating again and again, an endless rhythm, needing to bring a vision to life, the scope of which he has not yet measured.",
        "Texte18LAEC": "It is both here and already far away, carried off by his creative momentum, in the next step. Let yourself be transported, but how far? This seems to be the question that motivates him. The awareness of what inhabits him overwhelms and worries him. How far will he go, listening to this fundamental impulse which simultaneously nourishes and drives him?",
        "Texte19LAEC": "Always split between this powerful force which pushes him and his need for control which gives his work its accomplished form, he moves forward, continuing to surprise us all. Laumond, an artist that will leave his mark on this era, an oeuvre to be collected.",

    "CU": {
        "TitreCU": "Concordance Universelle",
        "TexteCU": "Patrick Laumond's work appears to derive from the plastic qualities and language of minimalism and conceptualism, born in reaction to the pictorial lyricism of expressionism. Rather than a profusion of colours and figurative and narrative tendencies, Laumond's installations are a priori embodied in abstraction, but also in the rigour and the coolness of an immaculate white. The forms are geometric, the lines straight, regular and homogeneous. The tensions and obliques underline an operative dynamic, at once mathematical, structural, even universal. However, unlike the leading exponents of Minimalism, such as Malevich's Suprematism or Mondrian's Neoplasticism, Laumond expresses no desire to strip life of life, that is to say, the sensitive and subjective part of the world, in order to reveal a phantasmal essence. Initiator of metaHism, whose prefix META denotes the Whole, ISME its own artistic trend and H, the eighth letter of the alphabet, an infinite movement symbolised by the lemniscate ∞, Laumond does not seek to formalise an art deprived of sentiment which would flirt, as was the case in the last century, with the totalitarian overtones and masculine values of modernity. Rather, in this almost tautological paradigm, we find the desire to inscribe an irresistible flaw, thus elevating contingency, accident and tilting to the rank of indispensable partners. The motif of the grid, driven by a supposed purity, neutrality and orderliness of things, will thus always be countered by a stain, drips or fractures. If Universal Concordance seems a distant evocation of the Minimalist vocabulary, with its pared-down forms, its monochromes and its utopias of metaphysical transcendence, it is ultimately the distortions of space, time and consciousness that retain the artist. Because if the matrix grid functions in a spatial and temporal manner, with its Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and its temporal reference t, for Laumond, it is the means by which consciousness reconnects to the multiple dimensions of reality, rather than repressing them. Embedded in rigid frameworks, his work constantly tends to resist the measure of an inflated rationality that detaches us from the sensitive world. In this way, modernist and Western considerations are decentred in favour of notions that privilege movement over structure, relationship over terms, contingency over necessity, otherness over identity. Rather than advocating frontality, modularity or repetition, his installations summon chaos through multiple ramifications and connections, where everything seems to be linked by a thin thread. In this sense, metaHism is an invitation to multiply perspectives and to embrace complexity. For if for a Westerner, consciousness is always a mental phenomenon: 'I think, therefore I am', it is because he apprehends the world only through his unique point of view, according to the symbolic model of the linear perspective that placed him at the centre of the world. By multiplying the focal points, a whole spectrum of consciousnesses is offered to us: animal, vegetable, cellular, molecular or atomic. Mental consciousness is only a human range that does not exhaust the gradation of possible consciousnesses, just as human sight does not exhaust all the gradations of colour nor does hearing those of sound. There is thus a range of consciousnesses, supramental and subramental, inaccessible to the human being, which in fact appear to be impossible, invisible or unconscious. In this way, metaHism is an attempt to reconcile the dichotomies laid down by modernity, and to include the various modes of existence that populate the world. As a result, it is no longer time and space that are the framework of phenomena, but bodies and the imperceptible interactions that influence them, as Einstein foresaw in general relativity. To grasp metaHism, we will therefore have to put on the glasses of a Möbius strip and accept that there is no longer linear or causal time, top or bottom, interiority or exteriority, order or disorder, but an intermingling of all possibilities, of which contingency is the name.",

        "Texte1CDA": "A white space within a black space. Like a world within a world. Or in other words an interplay of movement and relationships between normally closed spaces. In the curved infinity of space-time where everything is an illusion as Einstein already suspected at the beginning of the last century Patrick Laumond deploys a metaphysics similar to a matrix of variable possibilities. In his hometown of Saint-Viance within the Espace Labasse – a historic building – the artist tries his hand at the difficult reconciliation of philosophies sciences and beliefs. In a desire for impossible unification he eschews their frameworks to create better connections between them and attempts to break through the looking glass with a \"mobile for opening parallel universes\" according to the eponymous title of his enigmatic installation.",
        "Texte2CDA": "To understand his work it must be first noted that the latter results from a long and sinuous thought process which several years ago led him to invent MetaHisme. A self-proclaimed and tautological movement seeming to function with its own laws according to closed futile and sometimes incomprehensible systems in the manner of a \"solitary machine\" MetaHisme nevertheless includes a collection of terms which when juxtaposed reflect an archetypal complexity. First the prefix META which before Facebook privatized it comes from the Greek for thought change succession as well as the act of going beyond beside among or with. As for the suffix ISM it references its own artistic and even ideological movement in the image of impressionism futurism or Marxism. It thus summarizes and contains a set of notions or proposals that create the concept. Lastly the H the eighth letter of the alphabet symbolizes infinity in the manner of the lemniscate ∞ simultaneously frightening and prodigiously fascinating.",
        "Texte3CDA": "With his new work The Mobile for Opening Parallel Universes Patrick Laumond is once again testing the antinomic or symmetrical instances that make up the world. However it should not be assumed from this that Laumond functions according to a reductive binarism or Manichaeism. On the contrary he embraces opposites in order to make them converse and reason together thereby insisting on the plurality of perspectives rather than the naïve affirmation of a universal world that is to say versed in a single truth (which we know is often that of the dominant party). So is it possible to combine knowledge which is usually opposed like that of quantum mechanics with the theory of general relativity which describe respectively phenomena at the microscopic and macroscopic levels? Like so many physicists who dedicate their life to a hypothetical Theory of Everything capable of presiding over and subsuming the fundamental interactions of physics Laumond multiplies the attempts to reunite antagonistic systems. Based on the principle of quantum entanglement and the inseparability of particles like Plato's \"soulmates\" Stephen Hawking's \"parallel universes\" or \"Rorschach tests\" from clinical psychology the artist expends great effort in connecting worlds in a gesture that is both futile and poetic. Like magnets that repel or attract one another depending on their magnetic pole he searches for the motive or let's say the method to make these invisible tensions tangible. His work paradoxically hermetic and open plural and singular made up of suspended grids monoliths and mobiles definitively invites us to a meditation on the power of parallel worlds. Whether we believe that these universes are separated by immeasurable swaths of space or time or imperceptibly exist only a few millimeters from us the hypothesis of multiverses has become over recent years a theoretical configuration supported by the majority of advances in fundamental physics. However what the artist implicitly tells us here is that we ourselves live within these multiple interlocking universes. Each one of us has a singular view of the world and develops a specific technical scientific philosophical or poetic language and vocabulary. Hence the illusion of misunderstanding between individuals and the feeling of sometimes living in dissimilar universes presided over by distinct laws which only a theory that combines different viewpoints will be likely to unite. The alliance is difficult but that's also what creates the charm of these two magnets like lovers who attract and repel one another constantly.",

        "intro_text": "Patrick Laumond was born to a father from Cantal, a hydromechanics engineer, and a mother born in Brive la Gaillarde, trained as an aesthetician. He grew up in several regions of France. At 10 years old, he returned to Corrèze where he spent his adolescence. Constrained by his father who enrolled him at the Pierre Caraminot National Professional School in Egletons, he was a boarder there until obtaining his baccalaureate in mechanical engineering. At the time of choices, he joined the Henri Brisson National Higher Professional School in 1994, where he learned applied science in technical and industrial ceramics, in Vierzon. He was noticed by Jacky Trotereau, professor and head of the ceramics art and decoration laboratory, who allowed him direct entry into the 2nd year at the National Higher School of Arts and Applied Arts in Paris at Olivier de Serres (ENSAAMA). He graduated top of his class with jury congratulations for the presentation of his personal portfolio in 1996. At the same time, he did an internship with Delphine Charlotte Parmentier where he conceptualized accessories for Ungaro and Christian Lacroix and objects for the ceramics museum in Dunkerque. He decided to return to his native land in Corrèze and set up a ceramics workshop in the family home which he abandoned a few years later to become an artist. Back in Paris, he devoted himself essentially to painting. He met Madame Denyse Durand Ruel several times who supported him to participate in the prestigious residency of the French Institute in Japan (Villa Kujoyama) which was refused to him despite her recommendation. Among his influences can be cited, Antoni Tapiès, Yves Klein, Miquel Barceló, Joseph Heinrich Beuys.",

And already a precision of gesture, the desire to leave nothing to chance, to reproduce everything to scale; sharp, demanding, rigorous. Very quickly, it is the exploration of matter in all its forms. All materials: solid, liquid. The watchmaker becomes an alchemist. Hours spent transforming cardboard into leather, making mixtures, milk, walnut stain, studying chemical phenomena of attraction, repulsion, density... He experiments with stoneware, earthenware, porcelain, raku, glazes... kneads, mixes, deforms, fires, hammers, glues. The work of matter becomes an obsession. For 15 years, he will work on the realization of a stain. Exploring painting, its pigments, its components, the phenomena of solidification, heterogeneity, until controlling, mastering, modeling under his hand the expansion, the drips of this stain... until the perfect and unique realization, which will become his signature, his technique: the stained work.",

Then begins a period of great intensity for the artist, also a period of lightness, where he will have fun, play with these two elements.

The white work is a potential representation of all possible like infinity, eternity, the limit in the unlimited, it is always in opposition, connected to the stained work. They always position themselves in dialogue with each other encompassing a central work which is a different representation in form but identical in the idea of thought...\". Laumond Where the writer will use words to write his story, where ideograms have allowed with simple strokes the creation of a language without limits, Laumond has created a \"universal language\". In the Laumond universe, subjects, thoughts, concepts are symbolized by simple elements represented by a \"volumetric structure\", variable and yet constant form. His words are white or glass volumes and volumes worked in monochrome (stained). The volumes: Whether they are full or empty, white or transparent, immaculate or identified by their \"stain\", whether they are alone or connected to others, whatever their size, their shape, each of these volumes carries its meaning. They become parables. The link: Connected by an infinity of gray lines, which mark, unify, cut or connect space and works to each other, the volumes tell the global story. The stain: At the origin of his creative process, it is a monochrome worked to the extreme, \"mistreated\" to become alive. It could have sufficed, it is the Big Bang, the point of hatching, the vision of the real, of an identity visible to all.",
        "cerveau_title": "A work born from the right brain:",
        "cerveau_text": "The right brain manages images, it is synthetic and global. It functions not with codes but with analogies. It is the place of intuition, creativity, global vision. Laumond observes the world, from all angles and apprehends its globality, its explosion, balances in imbalance, paradoxes, possibilities. The vision he has of it is empathetic and encompasses a philosophical, scientific, humanistic and sensitive gaze. He has managed to develop a universe of absolute coherence. At the service of an endless reading and yet specific to each. The spectator becomes a true actor in the interpretation of these parables. He expresses a sharp, deep and acute gaze on the world, on its formats and on the \"human comedy\". No repentance, no correction, no addition is permitted to him by the demanding choice of white, immaculate, perfect, luminous, intransigent.",
        "holographique_title": "A holographic work:",
        "holographique_text": "Each volume is at the service of the whole and we can say that the whole of an installation is a work in itself. When we speak of a hologram, we mean that \"the whole is more than the sum of the parts, the part is in the whole, but the whole is in the part\". The most common example is that of an individual's genetic heritage found in each cell that composes it. It is the consciousness of what brings together the infinitely small to the infinitely large. He offers us visual and sensory interrogations about everything that surrounds us, the art world, its references and the end of painting, the artists and movements that preceded him, Duchamp, Fontana, but as a subtle and fertile analyst, he brings his aesthetic and formal response, his vision, his kaleidoscopic play and an aesthetics of perfection. In 2009, he conceptualized the MetaHism manifesto in the form of a work of art. Ten years later, he writes an undeclared declaration. In 2021, he is invited by the European Cultural Center of Italy (ECC Italy) to exhibit on the occasion of the Venice Biennale at the Bembo Palace. He exhibits \"Universal Concordance\". On the same occasion, he meets Marion Zilio, art theorist, art critic and member of AICA France. She writes an analysis that accompanies his work during his exhibition. He is invited to exhibit in his childhood town of Saint-Viance, an immersive work with augmented reality \"The mobile of opening of parallel universes\" in a consecrated building of France.",

He grew up in several regions of France. At 10 years old, he returned to Corrèze where he spent his adolescence. Constrained by his father who enrolled him at the Pierre Caraminot National Professional School in Egletons, he was a boarder there until obtaining his baccalaureate in mechanical engineering. At the time of choices, he joined the Henri Brisson National Higher Professional School in 1994, where he learned applied science in technical and industrial ceramics, in Vierzon. He was noticed by Jacky Trotereau, professor and head of the ceramics art and decoration laboratory, who allowed him direct entry into the 2nd year at the National Higher School of Arts and Applied Arts in Paris at Olivier de Serres (ENSAAMA). He graduated top of his class with jury congratulations for the presentation of his personal portfolio in 1996.",

The genesis of MétaHisme finds its origin in this reflection. For Patrick Laumond, it has always been necessary to define oneself as doing art rather than being an artist. Although this is often understood as a corollary to the act of creation, it seems to him that it is not the artist who determines art, but art that on the contrary determines the artist...",
